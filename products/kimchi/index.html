        <p>A Korean classic, spicy, fizzy fermented vegetable medley.</p>
        <p>Ingredients: nappa cabbage, carrot, daikon, green onion, ginger, Asian pear, garlic Korean red pepper and fish sauce</p>
        <p>How to use: as a side dish or in stir fries, stews, soups or salads. Mix in flour and cornstarch and fry to make kimchi pancakes. Our current favorite is adding a couple of spoons of this kimchi to fried eggs or on top of poached eggs. High in fiber and probiotics.</p>
